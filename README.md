<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

![Sociopedia Home Page Screenshot](./public/assets/home_screen.png)

This project is created based on [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8YELRmUb5o).

This project was completed as part of the <a href="https://openclassrooms.com/fr/courses/7150606-creez-une-application-react-complete">"Cr√©ez une application React compl√®te"</a> course created and distributed by OpenClassrooms.
This project has not been deployed, and therefore, must be cloned to be used.

The goal of this project is to build the web page of a freelance agency, using React.
And as the goal is to learn how to use React, the backend part of the project is directly provided by OpenClassrooms.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To use this project, you must have <a href="https://nodejs.org/en">Node.js</a> installed, and also <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads">Git</a> if you want to clone this repository. You can also use <a href="https://yarnpkg.com/">Yarn</a>, if you prefer it over npm.

### Installation

To install this project, you must :

1. Use your terminal to go in the directory you want to install the project in :
   ```sh
   cd path/to/your/directory
   ```
2. Run this command to clone the repo :
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/GWartelle/ShinyAgency.git
   ```
3. Go in the backend directory and run the command `npm install` (or `yarn` if you installed it) to install all the packages needed for the backend of the project :
   ```sh
   cd backend
   npm install
   ```
   ```sh
   cd backend
   yarn
   ```
4. Go in the frontend directory and run the same command to install the packages for the frontend :
   ```sh
   cd ../frontend
   npm install
   ```
   ```sh
   cd ../frontend
   yarn
   ```

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

## Usage

To use this web app you must :

1. Go back into the backend directory, and run `npm start` (or `yarn start`) to start the serverside of the app :

```sh
cd ../backend
npm start
```

```sh
cd ../backend
yarn start
```

2. Go back into the frontend directory, and run the same command to start the app, which will open up in your browser :

```sh
cd ../frontend
npm start
```

```sh
cd ../frontend
yarn start
```

This will lead you to the home page of the application. You'll find in the header of the page the logo of the app on the left and the navigation bar on the right. Downn you'll see an email input, which is here solely for demonstration sake, and a `Changer de mode` button to toggle on/off the dark mode.

On the center of the page (and in the header) if you click on the `Faire le test` button, this will open up the survey page.

On the survey page, once you answer all 6 of the questions, and click on `R√©sultats`, this will redirect you to the Results page, which points you out the type of freelance you might need for your project.

And now, if you click on `D√©couvrez nos profils` (or on `Profils` in the header), you will be redirected to the Profiles page, with examples of freelancer profiles, which you can select based on your needs.
